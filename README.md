# msfs-popblock
Small addon for blocking annoying disconnect popup

## Installation
Unzip the archive to your Community folder (or link it if using Addon linker).

## Usage
Addon adds new panel with "gear" icon visible in Toolbar. Once clicked a small panel titled "POPBLOCK" will appear. You can resize it or pop out and move to another screen. This panel must be open for the addon to work and close the disconnect message popup.

Working on another version that has completely transparent panel.
