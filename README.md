# msfs-popblock
Small addon for blocking annoying disconnect popup

## Installation
Unzip the archive to your Community folder (or link it if using Addon linker).

## Usage
There are two versions available:
- normal
- transparent  

Addon adds new panel with "gear" icon visible in Toolbar. Once clicked a small panel titled "POPBLOCK" will appear in normal version, transparent one won't display anything, the icon will turn white. For normal version, you can resize the panel or pop out and move to another screen. This panel must be open for the addon to work and close the disconnect message popup. For transparent version, the icon must be white.

As of version 1.1.0 both connectivity related notification popups are handled, you will still get the red and green popups showing you are offline or that the connection has been restored. This can easily be expanded to other popups/notifications. Tested only with english version of MSFS.
